# How to pack SVG icons individually into your application

This repository provides basic examples of how to include individual vector icons packaging your applications. Can be used as a cheatsheet of how to include easily icons of different types, order by categories.

## Why individual icons packaging is important
Building large applications, we need to use modular flexible third party dependencies that can be used without increase the source code size too much. I don't want a huge library of icons loaded in my app that I will never use, ever a collection of 30 icons of the same category. How do you split a category?
